# Applied Machine Learning for Social Science

This repository contains merely a sample of my code used to complete an assignment in the course 'Applied Machine Learning for Social Science' where the objective was the classification of personal attacks in Wikipedia talk page comments. This assignment was hosted as a competition on Kaggle which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/my474-classification-challenge-2021). Data to run the code can be downloaded from Kaggle and should be stored in the "Raw Data" folder.
