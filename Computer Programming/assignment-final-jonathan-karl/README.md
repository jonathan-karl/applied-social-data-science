### Coding Example - Jonathan Karl 

### This is extracted from the final assignment of the course MY470 Computer Programming, taught by Milena Tsvetkova

---

This final assignment from the course Computer Programming asks us to use the computational thinking and programming skills learned in the course to answer an empirical social science question using digital trace data.

In order to enable a smooth run of the files the folder "assignment-final-data" should be in the same directory as the folder "assignment-final-jonathan-karl" (e.g. both folders could be located in the folder "Computer Programming", which would then have to be the working directory). Another thing to note is that the folders or files in the folders should not be renamed.

Running the code is best done within the file "MY470_final_assign.ipynb" (a Juypter Notebook) which both explains the objective of this task and displays results.
