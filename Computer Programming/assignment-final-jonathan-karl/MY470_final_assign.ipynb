    "The final assignment asks you to use the computational thinking and programming skills you learned in the course to answer an empirical social science question. You are expected to apply the best practices and theoretical concepts we covered in the course to produce a program that not only returns the correct output but is also legible, modular, and reasonably optimized. The assignment assumes mastery of loops, conditionals, and functions, as well as awareness of issues related to runtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment, we will study the social contagion of cheating on the massive multiplayer online game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG). Cheating in this context means the adoption of unapproved software that gives the player an unfair advantage in the game (e.g. being able to see through walls). Our hypothesis is that players who observe cheating become likely to adopt cheating themselves. To test this hypothesis, we will first count how many observers of cheaters become cheaters within a certain period of time. We will call these **observer–cheater motifs**. We will then simulate alternative universes in which the players played the same game but happened to be killed by someone else. Finally, we will compare how the count of the observer–cheater motifs observed in the actual data compares to what we would expect in a \"randomized\" world.  \n",

In essence, we are looking for temporal motifs in which payer A observes B and then A becomes cheater, but the timing between the two events should not be more than 5 days.  \n",

    "Whereas literature suggests that behaviour is infectious, this analysis finds only a small (but after 100 randomisations and a hypothesis test) but significant effect of observing cheating on becoming a cheater (Centola, 2018). Whereas 215 of 85,263 players who observed cheating turn into cheaters, only an average of about 206 players \"become infected with cheating\" (based on the assumptions made) after randomising the compilation of each game of PlayerUnknown's Battleground in the data. In other words, the players for each game who observe cheating are randomised, which nurtures the conjecture that the amount of so-called motifs (players who start cheating within 5 days of having observed a cheater) are also randomised. Whereas, one fracture in that conjecture is that in most games where cheaters are participating, most players in such game also observe the cheater cheat, hence mitigating the impact of the randomisation, multiple randomisations do allow to test the hypothesis if cheating is in fact infectious in the context of this research. As mentioned above, a hypothesis test exhibited strong significance (p < 0.00001), hence implicating that, in the context of PlayerUnknown's Battleground, observing cheaters cheat seduces, although few, players to start cheating as well.\n",
