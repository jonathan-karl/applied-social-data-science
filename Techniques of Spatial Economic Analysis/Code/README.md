# Techniques of Spatial Economic Analysis

These coding files should be run after all data has been downloaded (see Raw Data README-file) in the following sequence. 

1. Rural_Urban_Classification.R
2. compute_luminosity.py
3. Data_Analyis.R

Only run compute_luminosity.py if your local machine has approximately 100GB of free storage as otherwise the kernel might die due to the sheer size of the granular nightlight images. Should this be the case, feel free to run smaller batches of nightlight luminosity analyses in the ipynb file where I have prepared a function for this case.

(please edit compute_luminosity.py so your personal working directory is included)
